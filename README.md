# Pizza-Sales-Dashboard

I built an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze one year of pizza sales performance and uncover business-driven insights from raw transactional data.

### 📊 Overview

* **Total Revenue:** 14.14M
* **Total Orders:** 49K
* **Average Order Value:** 290.89
* **Total Pizzas Sold:** 801.94K
* **Avg Pizzas per Order:** 1.00

### 🔍 Key Business Insights

**Customer Behavior**

* Orders peak on **weekends**, especially **Friday & Saturday afternoons**
* Customers typically purchase **one pizza per order** → strong opportunity for combo & upselling strategies

**Seasonality Trends**

* Highest demand in **May & July**
* Lowest sales observed in **October–November** → potential promotional months

**Product Performance**

* **Classic category** drives the most revenue and orders
* **Large size pizzas** contribute the highest share of total sales (≈52%)
* Category sales are relatively balanced, but Classic slightly dominates

**Operational Implications**

* Increase staffing & inventory on weekends
* Introduce bundles or add-ons to increase average items per order
* Launch promotions during low-season months
* Focus marketing on best-selling categories while testing new items in slower months
